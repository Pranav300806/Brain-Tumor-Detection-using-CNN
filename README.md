# 🧠 Brain Tumor Detection using CNN

## Project Overview
This project uses a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) to detect brain tumors from MRI scans.

It also includes a Streamlit web app for real-time image upload and prediction.

## Features
- MRI Image Classification
- CNN Deep Learning Model (TensorFlow/Keras)
- Streamlit Web App UI
- Upload MRI → Get Prediction instantly

## Tech Stack
Python • TensorFlow • Keras • OpenCV • Streamlit

## Run Locally
pip install -r requirements.txt
cd Streamlit_App
streamlit run app.py

## Output
Predicts:
- Tumor Detected
- No Tumor
val_accuracy: 0.8627 – 0.9020
